This project is to recreate the 6502 microprocessor that will be pin and instruction set compatible with the MOS Technology 6502 in the Apple II series of computer, and will be drop in compatible with that computer.

The project consists of HDL for the CPU, written in SystemVerilog, an instruction level emulator for the CPU, a full regression and unit test suite, a random code tester and demonstration and example code. Eventually, the HDL design will be implemented in hardware.
